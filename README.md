# Fitness_Blog_MERN

This blog is for fitness enthusiasts.

I used MERN(Mongodb, ExpressJs, ReactJs, NodeJs) stack to make this with my friend [Nitish](https://github.com/msnitish).


For running this application in local, follow these steps:

1. Run "npm install" command to install all the dependencies
2. For backend run "nodemon index.js" command in corresponding backend folder.
3. For frontend run "npm start" command in corresponding frontend folder.
