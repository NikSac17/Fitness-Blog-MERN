                    also allow for maximum intensity in any given session.</p>

                <p class="lead">Let’s cover some background knowledge first. It is a weightlifting training template
                    that divides and conquers your muscles into groups where each group is trained separately — allowing
                    other muscle groups to have the rest they deserve!
                    Muscles usually work in pairs. So when you are deadlifting, your back and biceps are doing the work
                    while your chest and triceps are relaxing.
                    Which makes this type of training perfect because on Day 1, you can smash your back and your biceps,
                    while giving your chest and triceps a break!</p>

                <p class="lead">The theory of nucleus overload training is training a body part for a month, you will
                    have more growth. The belief is that if you train a muscle group every single day, the nuclei within
                    that muscle increases and you have a better response. Seriously, professional research-based
                    bodybuilders don't do this. They stay abreast on the latest and greatest in sports training
                    technology.If you still want to try this training method, no one is going to stop you. I will say
                    that if you are doing some off the wall training that no one else in the fitness industry has even
                    heard of, it's probably a complete waste of your time.
